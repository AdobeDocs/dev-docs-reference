# Best Practices for Migration 

- **When you select a google doc index file a new google doc page will pop out. If you double click on the Index in the top left of the page - it will show you what folder you are located in.**:
- **Standard width is set at 1280**:
  - Standardizing width allows the page to align all the content blocks.
- **Background Colors**:
  - Default color is light grey. 
  - Some blocks have more options for background colors like Accordion and Columns.
- **Font Color**:
  - Allow some customization for font colors with blocks that have full images. 
  - Without images, there will be a default color that matches the backgrounds.
  - Default is spectrum light theme - Black and White 
- **Button Color**:
  - Primary button will remain Blue (unless its a blue background) 
  - If there is an image, you will be able to customize the button color. If there is no background color it will have a default color: Primary is Blue. 
- **Refer to the block Sidekick library for block specific customization**:
