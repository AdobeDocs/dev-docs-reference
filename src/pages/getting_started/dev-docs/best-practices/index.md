# Best Practices for Migration 

- Deployment:
  - If first time deploying, select Force deploy all files.
  - If not, optionally include base SHA to use as a baseline - this will only deploy diffs which speeds up deployment.
- Use kebab-case names for files and directories:
  - Either:
    1. Rename manually
        - Replace underscore (_) and period (.) with dash (-)
        - Remove special characters
        - Use lowercase letters for file names
        - Find and replace usages of that file in links
    2. Run scripts
        - `$ git config core.ignorecase false` (if not already set)
        - `$ yarn normalizeLinks`
        - `$ yarn renameFiles`
  - Why:
    - File paths with unsupported characters will fail to deploy to EDS.
    - Filenames are stricter in that underscores, periods, and uppercase letters are not allowed. Folder names are more lenient in that it allows underscores and uppercase letters, but not periods. For consistency and ease of remembering, it's best to use kebab-case all around.
- Config.md:
  - In Gatsby, Home is optional and overwrites Products
  - In EDS, Products is always displayed and Home must be the first path under Pages
- Paths:
  - Use absolute paths when linking to other repos
  - Use absolute paths when linking to DevBiz
  - Use relative paths when linking within repo
  - Relative paths should be relative to path prefix
  - Relative links should include file name and extension
    - except for anchor links that are in the current page (e.g. `[description](#anchor)`)
- Config paths:
  - Use absolute prod path for home 
    - e.g. `[Adobe Express Add-ons](https://developer.adobe.com/express/add-ons)`
  - Relative paths should be relative to path prefix and not start with "/"
    - e.g.  `[Add-on UI SDK](references/addonsdk/)`
  - Landing page (the page of the path-prefix) will not have side nav.
  - On any parent section page (like /guides/, /community/, etc.), the sidebar navigation automatically displays all the child pages within that section. For example, in the config.md, if there is any subpages (eg. /guides/code-contribution) which is within the same parent section, the sidenav will show up.  This contextual sidebar appears for any page that has sub-pages, helping users easily navigate through related content without having to go back to higher-level pages.
    - Example:
    - page: https://developer-stage.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/
- Remove unnecessary trailing slashes from paths:
  - `$yarn checkLinks`: is one way to detect these invalid paths.
    - Why:
      - In Gatsby, invalid URLs that have unnecessary trailing slashes will work. However, in EDS they won't work
  - `$yarn buildRedirects`: will redirect these invalid paths.
    - Why:
      - Redirects.json will redirect Gatsby bookmarks (from invalid form to correct form). It's best to do this for a limited period of time, around 4-6 weeks.
- Replace paths that start with '/' with absolute paths for now:
  - Replace with absolute paths.
  - Why:
    - In HTML, paths that start with '/' are treated as relative to domain. However, DevDocs doesn't handle this yet.
- Fix dead links:
  - `$yarn checkLinks`: lists dead links. Run to prevent 404s
- Fragments:
  - [Use fragment](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite-github-actions-test/blob/main/src/pages/fragment.md?plain=1#L5)
  - Imports are now fragments. The connector will ensure imports are now fragments. 
- New Block Names and Replacements::
  - Replace "Hero" default variant with "Superhero" default variant
  - Replace "Hero" halfwidth variant with "Superhero" halfWidth variant
  - Replace "Hero" fullwidth variant with "Superhero" centered variant
  - Replace "Teaser" with "Announcement"
  - Replace "DCSummary" with "Summary"
  - Replace "ResourceCard" with "InfoCard"
  - Replace "TextBlock" with "Cards" or "Columns"
  - Replace "AnnouncementBlock" with "Announcement"
  - In "InlineAlert" block replace "header" slot with "heading" slot
- Don't nest blocks:
  - Don't nest a block within another block. For example, a code block cannot be within a table block.
  - [Example](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/app-builder/commit/e464b3e8bb853c8ac255231f24f608e4d86d7951)
  This was trying to put the response within the table will not render because the response needs to be within a code block instead of within the table.
  - Why:
    - Direct nesting of blocks in the source document is not a supported or recommended practice in AEM Edge Delivery Services
- Links should use square brackets '[ ]' and not angle brackets '< >':
  - Lint error on publish
  - Link syntax calls for square brackets: https://github.com/adobe/aio-theme?tab=readme-ov-file#links
- Links to other file types than .md and .json needs to use raw github links for now:
  - example: if https://github.com/AdobeDocs/acrobat-sign-developer-guide/blob/afc014e786b19b579d374a5ff437042ac0b07a4a/src/pages/overview/embedpartner/provisioningfaq.md?plain=1#L16 the download the pdf link needs to be 
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdobeDocs/acrobat-sign-developer-guide/sign-pages-bugfix/src/pages/overview/embedpartner/223014.3-Adobe-Provisioning-Considerations-v2.pdf
  - We have a ticket open to fix this
- Quotes should match:
  - Lint error on publish
- Ensure relative paths are correct:
  - Broken link
- Table number of columns should be the same on all rows:
  - Table won't render otherwise
- Replace "Media" with "Embed". "Embed" urls shouldn't be wrapped in angle brackets '< >'.:
  - example: https://github.com/AdobeDocs/app-builder/commit/ddf3a8d9f692f2315edc81b485e9a14cfd5ba499	
  - Why:
    - Media and Embed were dupes. Only Embed exists now
    - Media syntax calls for angle brackets around the url: https://github.com/adobe/aio-theme?tab=readme-ov-file#media-block
    - Embed syntax calls for no angle brackets around the url
- Avoid `<br />` tag - Change any html characters with an escape character before.:
  - Example: `\<br /\>` will work.  or `\{ \}` or `\<li\>`
- While adding another repository URL, provide the direct link instead of the path.:
  - Why: It won't redirect otherwise
- Directly importing content from another repo doesn't work:
  - Because the file is unable to fetch data from the external repo.
- Escape any html tags within a table:
  - Example: `\<li /\>` within a table will render
- Place assets in src/pages (and not static folder):
  - Remove images or pdf content from static folder and put in src/pages folder	
- Assets are reading from the branch it was deployed from:
- Use languages properly in the code block:
- Use RedoclyAPIBlock to replace any openAPISpec:
  - `<RedoclyAPIBlock src="/cloud-storage/petstore.json" />`
    - notice path is
      - `/{pathPrefix}/{pathToRelativeFile}`
      - petstore.json is in static folder
  - example: https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite-github-actions-test/blob/main/src/pages/test/redocly-api-block.md?plain=1
- `---`, `* * *`, nor `<hr>` are supported as a horizontal ruler.  Replace with `<HorizontalLine />`:
- HTML tags nor custom CSS are supported.:
- Details HTML element vs. Details EDS block:
  - replace https://github.com/AdobeDocs/developer-distribute/blob/cab2937c97b088ff1ecbe722f9dd160f58c7de40/src/pages/index.md?plain=1#L36-L62
  - with https://github.com/AdobeDocs/developer-distribute/blob/2db41fa6ec5f4ae1f1d36643460f4e283ab55eeb/src/pages/index.md?plain=1#L36-L64
  - EDS does not support Details HTML element. Use the Details EDS block instead.
- SiteWidebanner:
  - Example: Add a file named site-wide-banner.json in the path:
    - /src/pages/site-wide-banner.json
    - Publish the page or deploy the file in the EDS branch, and it will be reflected automatically.
    - Example: https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite-github-actions-test/blob/main/src/pages/sitewidebanner.json
  - This new announcement banner component visually will be more similar to Spectrum’s alert banner. The alert banner is typically used for high-signal messages – they’re meant to prompt the user to take action. The announcement banner is the dev site’s version of the alert banner.
- To open link as external, use the query string `?aio_external` in your URL:
  - Example: https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite-github-actions-test/blob/main/src/pages/test/test-hr-0.md?plain=1#L13
  - This will have to open the external link manually.
