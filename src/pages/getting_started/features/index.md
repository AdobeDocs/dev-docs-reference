# Key Features

## Create Credentials Component 
The Create Credentials component eliminates a major friction point in the Adobe developer experience by enabling developers to generate API credentials directly on the Adobe Developer Website without redirecting to the Developer Console. Previously, developers reading documentation, API references, or tutorials had to navigate to a separate experience, sign in again, and become familiar with the Developer Console interface just to obtain credentials—a workflow that product teams identified as a significant barrier to API adoption. This component was developed in collaboration with the Developer Console and App Builder teams to streamline credential creation and reduce time-to-first-API-call for developers.

The component supports multiple APIs, both API Key and OAuth Server-to-Server credential types, and includes enhanced features like a return flow experience, request access workflows, and a newly designed Org Switcher. Combined with the Try It functionality, developers can now complete their entire workflow on a single page: navigate to API reference documentation, create or retrieve authentication credentials, paste them into the Try It block, and execute API calls—replacing the previous multi-step process that required toggling between Developer Console, documentation sites, and tools like Postman. The component is currently live supporting the AEP Platform API and is available for other product teams to implement by coordinating with the Developer Website and Console teams via the #create-credentials Slack channel.



## Private Beta and Secured Websites - Gatsby Only
The Private Beta and Secured Websites feature addresses a critical need for Adobe product teams to publish high-quality developer documentation and marketing content for beta programs and premium customer experiences behind authentication gates on developer.adobe.com. Previously, product teams like CCXT had to resort to distributing beta documentation as PDF files via email to NDA-approved developers—a workflow that created significant friction for both teams and developers. This manual process required extra effort to convert documentation to PDFs, degraded the developer experience by forcing users to search through email folders and potentially install additional software, and made updates nearly impossible without resending files to the entire group. The initiative was driven by CCXT's requirement to support Firefly beta websites and provides a scalable, durable mechanism for teams to iterate on new features and gather detailed feedback from select groups while maintaining confidentiality.

The solution provides architecture and infrastructure for secured websites that integrate with Adobe's pre-release program (Sofia/Floodgate) to verify access based on Adobe ID membership in product-maintained lists. When developers sign in, the system checks their eligibility against the pre-release program list to determine access to private beta content, enabling product teams to control who sees what documentation without managing separate distribution channels. Beyond private beta use cases, this feature also enables product teams to create logged-in customer experiences with premium content exclusively for their customers, giving teams flexibility in how they surface and deliver content. This approach provides a consistent, seamless developer journey directly on developer.adobe.com, eliminates the PDF distribution workflow, and allows teams to make real-time updates to documentation while maintaining the security and confidentiality required for pre-release products.

## Redocly 
The Redocly API Block enables product teams to generate and display interactive API reference documentation directly on the Adobe Developer Website without relying on iframes or external hosting. By using the `<RedoclyAPIBlock>` component with a URL pointing to an OpenAPI YAML file, teams can host their own API specifications and have them rendered seamlessly by Redocly within the site's native experience. This approach provides a more integrated developer experience, allowing API documentation to maintain consistent styling with the Developer Website while leveraging Redocly's robust API documentation features. The component requires an on-premise license key (managed by the dev-site team) to be added to the repository's deploy.yml file, with all public repos in the AdobeDocs organization having automatic access to this development environment secret.

The component offers customization options including adjustable right panel width (defaults to 500px) and typography controls for font family and size, ensuring flexibility to match specific product needs. While local development testing is limited due to how Redocly API works—requiring teams to temporarily deploy to stage for testing—the component supports best practices like using Redocly's `x-summary` specification extension for long API response descriptions to prevent text truncation and layout issues. Teams can also implement full-width pages using custom layouts, providing maximum flexibility for presenting complex API documentation. This solution streamlines the process of publishing professional, interactive API references while maintaining the cohesive Adobe Developer Website experience.
