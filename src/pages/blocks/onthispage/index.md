# On This Page

Automatically generated table of contents that appears on the right side of pages for quick navigation to different sections.

## How It Works

The component is **automatically generated** from your page headings. No configuration required.

- Scans your markdown for H2 (`##`) and H3 (`###`) headings
- Creates anchor links for each heading
- Displays them in a sidebar on the right
- Updates the active link as users scroll

## Example

![onthispage](../../assets/onthispage.png)

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive, concise headings
- Maintain clear H2 and H3 hierarchy
- Avoid very long heading text
- Keep nesting to H2 and H3 only
