## Where can I upload videos?

To use videos in blocks that accept video attributes, you need to provide a URL. Here are your options for uploading and hosting videos:

**GitHub**: Commit your video to your GitHub repository and copy the raw GitHub URL.

**Google Drive** (with 2-minute limit): Upload your video to Google Drive, open it, use the AEM Sidekick extension to publish, then copy the URL. Videos uploaded to Google Drive have a 2-minute limit.

**YouTube**: Upload videos to YouTube. This option has no time limit restrictions.
