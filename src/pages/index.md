# Welcome to the new Developer Website!

The ADP Developer Site Documentation provides a comprehensive list of guides on how to build documentation on the developer.adobe.com platform. 

## What is DevDocs
DevDocs is the technical documentation infrastructure that powers the Developer Website's comprehensive developer resources. Built on Edge Delivery Services, DevDocs provides product teams with a streamlined authoring experience where they can create and maintain technical documentation in markdown within their dedicated repositories in the AdobeDocs GitHub organization. Teams leverage configuration and content blocks to structure their documentation, ensuring consistency across the platform. With the flexibility to preview content in local development environments or staging, product teams can refine their documentation before deploying to production, making it accessible to developers worldwide.

## What is DevBiz
DevBiz is the marketing infrastructure that enables product teams to create compelling marketing pages on the Developer Website. Designed for ease of use, DevBiz allows teams to author content directly in Google Docs within organized Google Drive folders, eliminating the need for technical expertise. Product owners can draw from a rich library of reusable content blocks available in the Developer Website Sidekick, making it simple to create professional, on-brand marketing pages. The integrated Sidekick tool provides a seamless workflow for previewing changes and confidently deploying content to staging and production environments, ensuring marketing pages are polished and ready to engage developers.

### Why the change from Gatsby to EDS? 	

- Microsites on the Developer Website have become large and complex. As a result, there is an increased maintenance and support load that is unsustainable for the size of our team.
- Additionally, Gatsby has been acquired recently and support for its framework is unknown.
- The Developer Website team supports the platform for product teams to deploy documentation and marketing pages. Because we support teams across Adobe, we need to maintain the look and feel of the Website in a similar environment for the Developer Experience. When a change to the Global Navigation or Footer is needed, or an update across the whole platform, we need to push out a site wide theme update which is difficult to do withe current Gatsby setup.

### What are some benefits to EDS? 	
 
- Optimized content blocks for performance, analytics, accessibility and mobile responsiveness.
- Additional features such as A/B testing and RUM analytics will be offered by EDS.
- Currently, when pushing a deployment on Gatsby, there is downtime from 1-5 minutes as the changes are being pushed to production. In EDS, there will be no downtime and deployments will not cause their microsite to 404 while the new changes are pushed to production.
