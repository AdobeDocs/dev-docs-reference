# Adobe Developer Documentation Block Reference

The Adobe Developer Documentation Block Reference provides a comprehensive catalog of reusable content blocks for building rich, interactive documentation experiences.

## Overview

This reference site showcases all available blocks that can be used to create engaging developer documentation. Each block is a modular component designed to present specific types of content, from hero banners and code examples to interactive API documentation and media resources.

These blocks provide a consistent, standardized way to structure and display content across Adobe developer documentation sites. Whether you're building tutorials, API references, or product guides, these blocks enable you to create professional, accessible documentation efficiently.

## Categories of Blocks

There are two main categories of blocks available:

* **Configuration Blocks**: Essential navigation and layout configuration blocks including SideNav and TopNav. These blocks define the structure and navigation of your documentation site.
* **Content Blocks**: All content presentation blocks including heroes, accordions, code blocks, API documentation, tabs, and more. These blocks help you create and organize your documentation content with rich formatting and interactive elements.
